# Equipment Energy Consumption Prediction 
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting equipment energy consumption using real-world building sensor data. The goal is to understand usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and develop a machine learning model to forecast energy demand.

---

## Problem Statement

Understanding energy usage across different zones of a building can help reduce costs and promote sustainable practices. Using temperature and time-based features, we built a model to predict equipment energy consumption and provide actionable insights.

## Project Highlights

- âœ… **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Identified key drivers of energy usage like time of day and zone temperature. Detected outliers and abnormal spikes using visualizations.

- âœ… **Feature Engineering**  
  Created hour and day-based features to capture time trends. Dropped low-variance and random noise features.

- âœ… **Modeling Approach**  
  Tried Linear Regression (underfitting), then moved to Random Forest. Applied hyperparameter tuning to boost performance.

- âœ… **Insights & Recommendations**  
  Found operational hours (7â€“8 PM) with peak energy usage, zone-level inefficiencies, and proposed off-hour automation for savings.
